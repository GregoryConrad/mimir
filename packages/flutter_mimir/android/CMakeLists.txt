# The binary download/extraction is difficult to do concisely in Groovy/Gradle,
# at least across host platforms, so we are just reusing our Linux/Windows logic.

# The Flutter tooling requires that developers have CMake 3.10 or later
# installed. You should not increase this version, as doing so will cause
# the plugin to fail to compile for some customers of the plugin.
