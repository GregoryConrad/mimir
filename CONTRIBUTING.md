## Dependencies
The only supported path for local development is using the provided `flake.nix` and `direnv`, as:
- This is what I use
- This is what CI uses
- Everything will "just work"

If you don't want to go down that route (installing nix + direnv),
you can attempt to install all the packages listed in `flake.nix` manually.
